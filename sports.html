		<p>Clayton Lisowski grew up in Green Bay, Wisconsin. This has influenced his life in a lot of ways, but one in particular is his love for sports. He grew up watching the Packers all his life and they practically played right in his backyard. One of his most fond memories was winning the Super Bowl in 2010. Clayton played several sports growing up. When he was young he played football, basketball, and baseball. This was his yearly schedule of sports up until high school. At Notre Dame de la Baie Academy, Clayton only played football. He grew up loving football the most and ultimately would be the last sport he got to play competitively. </p>
