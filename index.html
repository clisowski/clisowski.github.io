		<p>Clayton Lisowski is a fifth year student at the <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/">University of Wisconsin- Madison</a>. He began his time at Wisconsin studying Biology as his intended major. Through meeting other students on campus, he discovered he had an interest in learning about coding. This led to him doing a "180" and switching his major late into his second year of college. Outside of school, Clayton spends most of his free time hanging out with his friends, watching movies, playing video games, and cheering on his favorite sports teams. </p>
